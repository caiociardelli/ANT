This notebook provides a practical implementation of the methods described in the paper, including step-by-step guidance and code examples for applying the phase-only response-removal technique in the computation of Empirical Green’s Functions (EGFs) for ambient-noise tomography.

Please refer to the paper for a detailed explanation of the methodology and theoretical background.
